        <h2>Project Planning</h2>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>Overall, the goals and objectives of the project encompass showcasing skills,
           addressing the specific needs of a Solar Panel Installation company, 
           implementing essential features such as secure login, real-time weather 
           information, inventory management, and user management, as well as providing 
           a roadmap for future enhancements.</p>

           <h3>Scope</h3>
           <p>The SolarPanelDashboard project aims to enhance Solar Life's stock inventory
             management system by implementing a web app solution. The project's scope includes
              the following features and functionalities:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Dashboard: Develop a comprehensive dashboard to manage company procedures
               and streamline stock inventory management processes.</li>
             <li>Authentication: Implement user authentication with different access levels and
               permissions based on roles (admin, staff) to ensure secure system access.</li>
             <li>Inventory Tracking: Create a database to store product information and stock
               levels, enabling real-time updates and functionalities to add, update, and view 
               product details.</li>
             <li>Notifications: Implement low stock alerts to notify the admin when stock 
              levels fall below a specified threshold, ensuring proactive management.</li>
             <li>Mobile Access: Design a responsive user interface optimized for mobile devices,
               enabling anytime, anywhere access to the stock inventory management system.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>The future state of the project, which is out of scope for the initial 
            release, includes potential integrations with weather APIs, CRM 
            functionality, a mobile app for job and staff scheduling, time-tracking, 
            website integration or rebuilding for product information sharing, and 
            messaging features for user communication and notifications.</p>
           <p>The proposed solution utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, 
            Node) for development, providing a robust foundation. It focuses on main 
            features such as stock inventory management, user role management, a 
            scalable dashboard, an intuitive user experience, cross-device accessibility
            , real-time updates, and security and data protection with secure 
            authentication, role-based access control, and secure API endpoints.</p>
           <p>By implementing these features and functionalities, the 
            SolarPanelDashboard project aims to enhance Solar Life's stock inventory 
            management system, improve efficiency, provide real-time information, enable
             mobile accessibility, and ensure data security and protection.</p>
