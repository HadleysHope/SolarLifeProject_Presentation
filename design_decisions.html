        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>

        <h3>Tech Stack Choices</h3>
<p>The project leverages the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, incorporating 
  specific programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools to meet the project's
   requirements and goals.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> As the chosen document database, MongoDB provides a 
    schema-less and non-relational approach, allowing for flexible data management. Its 
    compatibility with JSON format simplifies data manipulation and supports scalability,
     making it an ideal choice for the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> Express.js, a web application framework based on 
    Node.js, enables the development of efficient and robust web apps and APIs. By 
    utilizing Express.js, the project benefits from streamlined server-side code creation
     and the ability to build REST APIs, enhancing data retrieval through HTTP queries.
    </li>
  <li><strong>React.js:</strong> React.js, a popular JavaScript library, powers the 
    front-end development of the project. Its declarative nature facilitates the creation
     of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, optimizing page loading times and 
     enabling smooth animations. React.js allows for code reusability and simplifies the
      management of view state and data changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Node.js serves as the premier JavaScript web server, 
    leveraging its lightning-fast performance and scalability to handle network 
    applications. Its unified approach to web development enables the use of a single 
    programming language for both the server and client sides. Node.js modules facilitate
     code organization and enhance development efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chosen tech stack of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js creates a 3-tier 
  architecture (frontend, backend, and database) fully utilizing JavaScript and JSON. 
  React.js handles the client-side user interface, Express.js manages server-side 
  operations, and Node.js provides a scalable server environment. MongoDB seamlessly 
  integrates with the stack, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>These tech stack choices were made to ensure efficient development, scalability, 
  flexibility, and optimal performance throughout the project. The MERN stack, with its 
  comprehensive set of tools and libraries, provides a solid foundation for building 
  modern and feature-rich web applications.</p>

  <h3>Architectural Considerations</h3>
  <p>During the design process, we carefully evaluated various options for the architectural components of the project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Front-End:</strong> The decision came down to React or Django. Despite 
      having limited experience with React and more experience with Django, we opted to
       expand our knowledge by exploring something new. We believed that React would 
       provide a more robust user experience, and we were particularly interested in 
       implementing authentication using web tokens and managing users from a separate 
       database instead of relying solely on the built-in Django admin.</li>
    <li><strong>Database and Authentication:</strong> After considering options such as 
      SQL databases and Firebase, we settled on MongoDB for its flexibility in handling
       non-structured data. Given the potential for developing unknown features in the 
       future, MongoDB's scalability became a crucial factor. While we had previous 
       experience with Firebase for authentication, we found it challenging to implement
        and opted for MongoDB as a more user-friendly alternative.</li>
    <li><strong>Express and Node.js:</strong> Due to our prior experience and 
      familiarity, Express and Node.js were the natural choices for server-side 
      implementation. We recognized the efficiency and reliability of these technologies
       and their compatibility with the overall stack.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By carefully considering the strengths and weaknesses of each option, we made 
    architectural choices that would enhance the project's functionality, user 
    experience, scalability, and development process. The combination of React, 
    MongoDB, Express, and Node.js provided a solid foundation for achieving our project 
    goals and delivering a high-quality web application.</p>
      

    <h3>UI Design Decisions</h3>
    <p>When designing the user interface (UI), we prioritized delivering a top-notch user experience. Our goal was to create an app with simple and intuitive navigation, leveraging the use of color to achieve various objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual Appeal and Aesthetics: We aimed to create a visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing interface that would engage users.</li>
      <li>Brand Identity: We carefully selected colors to align with our brand's identity and convey its personality, ensuring consistency throughout the app.</li>

          <img src="images/ColorScheme.JPG" alt="Branding ColourScheme">
          <div class="caption">Colour Scheme</div>
        </div>
      <li>Communication and Emotional Impact: Colors were chosen strategically to communicate messages, evoke specific emotions, and enhance user engagement.</li>
      <li>Visual Hierarchy and Information Organization: Through the use of color, we established a clear visual hierarchy and organized information to guide users and prioritize their attention.</li>
      <li>Accessibility and Usability: We considered color contrast to ensure readability and usability for all users, adhering to accessibility guidelines for an inclusive experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To achieve these objectives, our UI design process involved several stages,
       including <a href="./sketching.html">sketching</a>,<a href="./wireframes.html">
      wireframing</a>, and <a href="./prototype.html">prototyping.</a> We iteratively refined the 
       design to ensure an optimal user experience that met our goals and provided a 
       visually pleasing interface.</p>
